## How-To-Download

Look at the middle then go right a bit then up and you see a button that says / shows [code](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/860770979181887548/860811468806422548/unknown.png). Click that and it will download a .zip file. Just extract the files from that and run the "install.bat". When that is done, go to config.json and change your config there (token and prefix). Click the "run.bat" to start the bot :)
